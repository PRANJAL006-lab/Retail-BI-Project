## 🧠 Theoretical Basis

Retail analytics uses transaction records to identify trends and optimize decision-making. Common KPIs include:

* Gross sales by product or city
* Net returns and refund rates
* Average order value (AOV)
* High-performing time windows (morning, weekend)

This dashboard uses Python to clean and aggregate data and Dash to serve visual analytics.

## 🔣 Sample Code Snippet (Data Processing)

```python
import pandas as pd

def load_and_merge_data():
    sales = pd.read_csv('data/transactions.csv')
    products = pd.read_csv('data/products.csv')
    returns = pd.read_csv('data/returns.csv')

    sales['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(sales['Date'])
    merged = sales.merge(products, on='ProductID')
    merged = merged.merge(returns, on='TransactionID', how='left')
    merged['Returned'] = merged['Returned'].fillna(False)
    return merged
```
